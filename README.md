# Terralance

The basic game idea is a civilization-type empire builder, with much simpler mechanics than the genre's namesake.
The key feature is the so-called Terralance structure, which instantly transports troops to a connected Terralance
on a different planet. Inter-planetary logistics and trade will be crucial to progress in the technology tree
and to conquer the other colonies and dominate the solar system.

The game will be made with a low level language and as few external libraries as possible. The main library that
will be used is [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com).

The project will take a long time...

# Todo
[ ] redo client probably

[ ] Map format not convenient. I think the color stuff needs to be calculated on server side,
  not client side. Here's what I think needs to happen:
  
  [x] Reformulate Map data type
  [x] Create algorithm for encoding map
  [x] Create algorithm for decoding map on client
  [ ] And then I can probably start setting up actual networking stuff

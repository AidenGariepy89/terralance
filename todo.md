# Todo
- redo client probably

- Map format not convenient. I think the color stuff needs to be calculated on server side,
  not client side. Here's what I think needs to happen:
  
  - Reformulate Map data type
  - Create algorithm for encoding map
  - Create algorithm for decoding map on client
  - And then I can probably start setting up actual networking stuff
